# High Priority
- Automated test for broken links https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/controlling-urls-and-links-in-jekyll 
- Find a better default banner for sharing!


# Low Priority
- Have different blogs sorted by data, categories, etc. So have urls like blog/recent, blog/categoriesâ€¦ Have blog/ redirect to blog/recent

#Completed
- Tweeting post is broken, and Facebook sharing is clunky and unintuitive. E.g. Twitter does not share a link at all, only a tweet with the title as text. Facebook sharing works, but to the user it looks as if he is sharing the home page instead of the post.
